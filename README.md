The goal of this project is to develop a full-fledged machine learning package that will carry out analysis of the results generated from ADAP-BIG. Specific objectives of ADAP-ML is to provide both uni-variate and multi-variate statistical analysis/machine learning methods for detecting biomarkers. Interactive capabilities with the data through visualization is useful to have, but ADAP-ML should try to minimize the reliance on users to interact with the data to extract knowledge from the data.
